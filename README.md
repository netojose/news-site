## About the project

This was my first contact with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and I liked of the result. I decided to learn something new while creating this challenge, instead of use tools I already familiar with. Normally for this case, I use some CSS in JS approach for styling.

## Pending work

- Write intgration tests for testing all process (I like to use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)).
- On unit tests, write more tests, mocking fetch.
